I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(We're gonna go on and on and on and on)
We are the champions, my friend
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
Cause we are the champions
Of the world
